# employee-tracker

This app will allow you to view all current employees and make changes to the list of employees. The employee list will give you information like the employee's first and last name, their job title and department, salary and their manager's name. You can then make changes to this like add a new employee, remove an employee, and update the employee or manager information.

This app was made using node.js and MySQL.
